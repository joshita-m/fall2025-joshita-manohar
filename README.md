I chose Option A where I created separate HTML files for each major page/section of my project. This is because my design includes using a burger menu tab instead of making the multiples pages of my project a button. I intend on users navigating between the pages through using this burger menu and/or hyperlinks within the page(s) that direct the user where to go through the natural flow of the wesbite. The biggest challenge I anticipate is the execution of the design itself. I drew up a high-fidility version of my website with a vision of how I want it to look - making this come to life will be the tricky part.
