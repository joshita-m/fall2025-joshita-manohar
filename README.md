I chose Option A where I created separate HTML files for each major page/section of my project. This is because my design includes using a burger menu tab instead of making the multiples pages of my project a button. I intend on users navigating between the pages through using this burger menu and/or hyperlinks within the page(s) that direct the user where to go through the natural flow of the wesbite. The biggest challenge I anticipate is the execution of the design itself. I drew up a high-fidility version of my website with a vision of how I want it to look - making this come to life will be the tricky part.

Oct 29. Referring to what we learned in the previous class, I used JavaScript to display information about the 'Newborn & Infant' routine. I created an array of data - sleep, play, feeding and hygiene and used a loop to generate HTML elements automatically. This allows the information to automatically appear on the page instead of me manually typing it out. 
Understanding how to connect my script to my html took a few trials. It was also hard for me to conceptualize what I was coding as I was creating the script. 

Nov 12. Referring to last class, I css coded the design layout of the 'Home' page. I added shapes and animated the color to change when you hover over it. I'm still trying to figure out how to animate the burger menu and reduce the page size.
